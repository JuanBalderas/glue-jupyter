Glue in the Jupyter Notebook
============================

About
-----

The **glue-jupyter** package provides a way to use the `glue
<http://glueviz.org/>`_ package for multi-dimensional linked-data exploration in
the `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ notebook and Jupyter Lab. This package is
still in early development, but it is already possible to try out some of the
functionality. If you run into any issues or would like to request features,
please head over to our `issue tracker
<https://github.com/glue-viz/glue-jupyter/issues>`_.
